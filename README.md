# Project Description
 The project aims to develop a pipeline for predicting the primary category of products found on flipkart by using their description and images.
 The Colab notebooks and their description are as follows:

### Colab Notebooks:
*	Data Cleaning and EDA :Extracting relevant data from the given dataset, cleaning it up and visualizing insights about the data.
*	Approach 1: Creating a LSTM based deep learning model and training it on preprocessed data
*	Approach 2: Setting up a BERT model and training it on preprocessed data 
*	Approach 3: Creating a hybrid deep learning model taking both images and descriptions as input and then training it on preprocessed data  
*	Approach 4: Creating 4 different machine learning models and training them on preprocessed data
*	Approach 5: Creating a CNN based deep learning model and training it on preprocessed data
*   Results Analysis: Detailed results of various models

### Libraries Used:
The following libraries were used for data exploration and model development â€“
* Numpy, Pandas: Data loading and Manipulation
* Sklearn: For Data preprocessing, machine learning models and evaluation metrics
* Seaborn, Matplotlib: Data Visualization
* Requests, BeautifulSoup: Scraping data from flipkart
* Tensorflow: Deep Learning models
* CV2, PIL: Image loading and processing
* TQDM: Timeline View
* Gensim: NLP Preprocessing

# Approach

## Data Cleaning

It was observed that some products do not have a primary category. For such products, flipkart webste was scraped and category was obtained. If a category was still not found, the products were removed.
The duplicate categories were merged.
A total of 22 unique categories were identified. 
Null occurences were removed for descriptions (only 3 were present) and final dataframe was saved.

#### For the descriptions, the following process was followed:
1. Convert text to lower case
2. Remove punctuations and numbers
3. Remove stopwords
4. Remove contractions
5. Remove stray characters

## Data Visualization

The cleaned data was visualized to gain meaningful insights.
Wordcloud visualization is as follows:

For all categories, most appearing words were plotted. For example, for the clothing category, [women,online,shirt] were most occuring words.

Overall word length distribution stated that the average description had 47 words. For individual categories also, boxplot was plotted for the word distribution.
